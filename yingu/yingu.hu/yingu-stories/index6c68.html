<p>Jesus, you must realize the serious charges facing you.&nbsp;<br />You say you're the Son of God in all your handouts,&nbsp;<br />Well, is it true?</p>
<p>JESUS&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what you say, you say that I am.</p>
<p>ANNAS&nbsp;</p>
<p>There you have it gentlemen.&nbsp;<br />What more evidence do we need?&nbsp;<br />Judas, thank you for the victim.&nbsp;<br />Stay a while and you'll see him bleed!</p>
