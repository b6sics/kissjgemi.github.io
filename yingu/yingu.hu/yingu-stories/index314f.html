<p>I don't know how to love him.&nbsp;<br />What to do, how to move him.&nbsp;<br />I've been changed, yes really changed.&nbsp;<br />In these past few days, when I've seen myself,&nbsp;<br />I seem like someone else.<br />I don't know how to take this.&nbsp;<br />I don't see why he moves me.&nbsp;<br />He's a man. He's just a man.&nbsp;<br />And I've had so many men before,&nbsp;<br />In very many ways,&nbsp;<br />He's just one more.<br />Should I bring him down?&nbsp;<br />Should I scream and shout?&nbsp;<br />Should I speak of love,&nbsp;<br />Let my feelings out?&nbsp;<br />I never thought I'd come to this.&nbsp;<br />What's it all about?<br />Don't you think it's rather funny,&nbsp;<br />I should be in this position.&nbsp;<br />I'm the one who's always been&nbsp;<br />So calm, so cool, no lover's fool,&nbsp;<br />Running every show.&nbsp;<br />He scares me so.<br />I never thought I'd come to this.&nbsp;<br />What's it all about?<br />Yet, if he said he loved me,&nbsp;<br />I'd be lost. I'd be frightened.&nbsp;<br />I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope.&nbsp;<br />I'd turn my head. I'd back away.&nbsp;<br />I wouldn't want to know.&nbsp;<br />He scares me so.&nbsp;<br />I want him so.&nbsp;<br />I love him so.<br /></p>
