Jesus, why do you take so long?&nbsp;<br />Oh come on, King of the Jews.<br />Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ?&nbsp;<br />Mr. Wonderful Christ?&nbsp;<br />You're a joke. You're not the Lord.&nbsp;<br />You are nothing but a fraud.&nbsp;<br />Take him away.&nbsp;<br />He's got nothing to say!&nbsp;<br />Get out you King of the,&nbsp;<br />Get out King of the,&nbsp;<br />Oh get out you King of the Jews!&nbsp;<br />Get out of here!&nbsp;<br />Get out of here you,&nbsp;<br />Get out of my life.</p>
