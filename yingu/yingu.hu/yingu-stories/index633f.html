I saw him.&nbsp;<br />He looked three-quarters dead!&nbsp;<br />And he was so bad I had to turn my head.&nbsp;<br />You beat him so hard that he was bent and lame,&nbsp;<br />And I know who everybody's going to blame.&nbsp;<br />I don't believe he knows I acted for our good.&nbsp;<br />I'd save him all this suffering if I could.&nbsp;<br />Don't believe...our good...&nbsp;<br />And I'd save him if I could...<br /><br />ANNAS&nbsp;<br /><br />Cut the confessions, forget the excuses.&nbsp;<br />I don't understand why you're filled with remorse.&nbsp;<br />All that you've said has come true with a vengeance.&nbsp;<br />The mob turned against him, you backed the right horse.<br /><br />CAIAPHAS&nbsp;<br /><br />What you have done will be the saving of everyone.&nbsp;<br />You'll be remembered forever for this.&nbsp;<br />And not only that, you've been paid for your efforts.&nbsp;<br />Pretty good wages for one little kiss.<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />Christ, I know you can't hear me,&nbsp;<br />But I only did what you wanted me too.&nbsp;<br />Christ, I'd sell out the nation,&nbsp;<br />For I have been saddled with the murder of you.<br />I have been spattered with innocent blood.&nbsp;<br />I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud.&nbsp;<br />I have been spattered with innocent blood.&nbsp;<br />I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud!<br />I don't know how to love him.&nbsp;<br />I don't know why he moves me.&nbsp;<br />He's a man. He's just a man.&nbsp;<br />He is not a king. He is just the same&nbsp;<br />As anyone I know.&nbsp;<br />He scares me so!<br />When he's cold and dead will he let me be?&nbsp;<br />Does he love me too? Does he care for me?<br />My mind is in darkness.&nbsp;<br />God, God I'm sick. I've been used,&nbsp;<br />And you knew all the time.&nbsp;<br />God, God I'll never ever know why you chose me for your crime.&nbsp;<br />You're so bloody, Christ.&nbsp;<br /><br />CHOIR&nbsp;<br /><br />Poor old Judas. So long Judas.<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />You have murdered me.</span></p>
