This is my blood you drink.&nbsp;<br />This is my body you eat.&nbsp;<br />If you would remember me when you eat and drink.<br />I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered.&nbsp;<br />Yes, I must be out of my head.&nbsp;<br />Look at your blank faces. My name will mean nothing&nbsp;<br />Ten minutes after I'm dead.&nbsp;<br />One of you denies me.&nbsp;<br />One of you betrays me.<br /><br />APOSTLES&nbsp;<br /><br />No! Who would?! Impossible!<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />Peter will deny my in just a few hours.&nbsp;<br />Three times will deny me,&nbsp;<br />And that's not all I see.&nbsp;<br />One of you here dining,&nbsp;<br />One of my twelve chosen&nbsp;<br />Will leave to betray me.<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />Cut the dramatics!&nbsp;<br />You know very well who.<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />Why don't you go do it?<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />You want me to do it!<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />Hurry, they are waiting.<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />If you knew why I do it<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />I don't care why you do it!<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />To think I admired you.&nbsp;<br />Well now I despise you.<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />You liar. You Judas.<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />You want me to do it!&nbsp;<br />What if I just stayed here&nbsp;<br />And ruined your ambition.&nbsp;<br />Christ you deserve it.<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />Hurry, you fool. Hurry and go.&nbsp;<br />Save me your speeches,&nbsp;<br />I don't want to know. Go!<br /><br />APOSTLES&nbsp;<br /><br />Look at all my trials and tribulations&nbsp;<br />Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.&nbsp;<br />What's that in the bread? It's gone to my head,&nbsp;<br />'Till this morning is this evening, life is fine.<br />Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.&nbsp;<br />Knew that I would make it if I tried.&nbsp;<br />Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,&nbsp;<br />So they'll all talk about us when we've died.<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />You sad, pathetic man, see where you've brought us to,&nbsp;<br />Our ideals die around us and all because of you.&nbsp;<br />But the saddest cut of all:&nbsp;<br />Someone has to turn you in.&nbsp;<br />Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal.&nbsp;<br />A jaded mandarin,&nbsp;<br />A jaded mandarin,&nbsp;<br />Like a jaded, faded, faded, jaded, jaded mandarin.<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />Get out they're waiting! Get out!&nbsp;<br />They're waiting, Oh, they are waiting for you!<br /><br />JUDAS&nbsp;<br /><br />Every time I look at you I don't understand&nbsp;<br />Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.&nbsp;<br />You'd have managed better if you had it planned...<br />Oh....<br /><br />APOSTLES&nbsp;<br /><br />Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.&nbsp;<br />Knew that I would make it if I tried.&nbsp;<br />Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,&nbsp;<br />So they'll still talk about us when we've died.<br /><br />JESUS&nbsp;<br /><br />Will no one stay awake with me?&nbsp;<br />Peter, John, James?&nbsp;<br />Will none of you wait with me?&nbsp;<br />Peter, John, James?</span></p>
