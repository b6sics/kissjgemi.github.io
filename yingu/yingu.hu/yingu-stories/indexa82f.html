Jesus!&nbsp;<br />You've started to believe<br />The things they say of you.<br />You really do believe<br />This talk of God is true.&nbsp;<br />And all the good you've done<br />Will soon get swept away.<br />You've begun to matter more<br />Than the things you say.<br /><br />Listen Jesus I don't like what I see.<br />All I ask is that you listen to me.<br />And remember, I've been your right hand man all along.<br />You have set them all on fire.<br />They think they've found the new Messiah.<br />And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong.<br /><br />I remember when this whole thing began.<br />No talk of God then, we called you a man.<br />And believe me, my admiration for you hasn't died.<br />But every word you say today<br />Gets twisted 'round some other way.<br />And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied.<br />Nazareth, your famous son should have stayed a great unknown<br />Like his father carving wood He'd have made good.<br />Tables, chairs, and oaken chests would have suited Jesus best.<br />He'd have caused nobody harm; no one alarm.<br /><br />Listen, Jesus, do you care for your race?<br />Don't you see we must keep in our place?<br />We are occupied; have you forgotten how put down we are?<br /><br />I am frightened by the crowd.<br />For we are getting much too loud.<br />And they'll crush us if we go too far.<br />If they go too far....<br /><br />Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.<br />Please remember that I want us to live.<br />But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour.<br />All your followers are blind.<br />Too much heaven on their minds.<br />It was beautiful, but now it's sour.<br />Yes it's all gone sour.<br /><br />Listen, Jesus, to the warning I give.<br />Please remember that I want us to live.<br />C'mon, c'mon&nbsp;<br />He won't listen to me ...<br />C'mon, c'mon&nbsp;<br />He won't listen to me ...</span></p>
