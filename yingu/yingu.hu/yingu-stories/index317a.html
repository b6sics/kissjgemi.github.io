Why are we the ones&nbsp;<br />Who see the sad solution - know what must be done?&nbsp;<br />I have no thought at all about my own reward.&nbsp;<br />I really didn't come here of my own accord.&nbsp;<br />Just don't say I'm damned for all time.<br /><br />ANNAS<br /><br />Cut the protesting, forget the excuses.&nbsp;<br />We want information. Get up of the floor.<br /><br />CAIAPHAS<br /><br />We have the papers we need to arrest him.&nbsp;<br />You know his movements. We know the law.<br /><br />ANNAS<br /><br />Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded.<br /><br />CAIAPHAS<br /><br />We'll pay you in silver, cash on the nail.&nbsp;<br />We just need to know where the soldiers can find him.<br /><br />ANNAS<br /><br />With no crowd around him.<br /><br />CAIAPHAS<br /><br />Then we can't fail.<br /><br />JUDAS<br /><br />I don't want your blood money!<br /><br />CAIAPHAS<br /><br />Oh, that doesn't matter, our expenses are good.<br /><br />JUDAS<br /><br />I don't need your blood money!<br /><br />ANNAS<br /><br />But you might as well take it. We think that you should.<br /><br />CAIAPHAS<br /><br />Think of the things you could do with that money,&nbsp;<br />Choose any charity - give to the poor.&nbsp;<br />We've noted your motives.&nbsp;<br />We've noted your feelings.&nbsp;<br />This isn't blood money - it's a ...<br /><br />ANNAS<br /><br />A fee.<br /><br />CAIAPHAS<br /><br />A fee nothing more.<br /><br />JUDAS<br /><br />On Thursday night you'll find him where you want him.&nbsp;<br />Far from the crowds, in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br /><br />CHOIR<br /><br />Well done Judas. Good old Judas.</span></p>
