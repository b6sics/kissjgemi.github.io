<p>I only want to say,&nbsp;<br />If there is a way,&nbsp;<br />Take this cup away from me<br />For I don't want to taste its poison.&nbsp;<br />Feel it burn me,&nbsp;<br />I have changed.&nbsp;<br />I'm not as sure, as when we started.&nbsp;<br />Then, I was inspired.&nbsp;<br />Now, I'm sad and tired.&nbsp;<br />Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations,&nbsp;<br />Tried for three years, seems like thirty.&nbsp;<br />Could you ask as much from any other man?<br />But if I die,&nbsp;<br />See the saga through and do the things you ask of me,&nbsp;<br />Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me, nail me to their tree.&nbsp;<br />I'd want to know, I'd want to know, My God,&nbsp;<br />I'd want to know, I'd want to know, My God,&nbsp;<br />Want to see, I'd want to see, My God,&nbsp;<br />Want to see, I'd want to see, My God,&nbsp;<br />Why I should die.&nbsp;<br />Would I be more noticed than I ever was before?&nbsp;<br />Would the things I've said and done matter any more?&nbsp;<br />I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,&nbsp;<br />Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,&nbsp;<br />Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord,&nbsp;<br />Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord,&nbsp;<br />If I die what will be my reward?&nbsp;<br />If I die what will be my reward?&nbsp;<br />Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,&nbsp;<br />I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord,&nbsp;<br />Why should I die? Oh why should I die?&nbsp;<br />Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?&nbsp;<br />Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain.&nbsp;<br />Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die.&nbsp;<br />You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why.&nbsp;<br />Alright, I'll die!&nbsp;<br />Just watch me die!&nbsp;<br />See how I die!<br />Then I was inspired.&nbsp;<br />Now, I'm sad and tired.&nbsp;<br />After all, I've tried for three years, seems like ninety.&nbsp;<br />Why then am I scared to finish what I started,&nbsp;<br />What you started - I didn't start it.&nbsp;<br />God, thy will is hard,&nbsp;<br />But you hold every card.&nbsp;<br />I will drink your cup of poison.&nbsp;<br />Nail me to your cross and break me,&nbsp;<br />Bleed me, beat me,&nbsp;<br />Kill me.&nbsp;<br />Take me, now!&nbsp;<br />Before I change my mind.<br /></p>
