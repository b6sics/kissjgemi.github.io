<h3>1. What are two reasons for physical layer protocols to use frame encoding techniques? (Choose two.)</h3>
<p>to reduce the number of collisions on the media</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">to distinguish data bits from control bits*</span></strong></p>
<p>to provide better media error correction</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>to identify where the frame starts and ends*</strong></span></p>
<p>to increase the media throughput</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>An encoding technique converts a stream of data bits in a predefined code that can be recognized by both the transmitter and the receiver. Using predefined patterns helps to differentiate data bits from control bits and provide better media error detection.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>2. What is indicated by the term throughput?</h3>
<p>the guaranteed data transfer rate offered by an ISP</p>
<p>the capacity of a particular medium to carry data</p>
<p>the measure of the usable data transferred across the media</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the measure of the bits transferred across the media over a given period of time*</strong></span></p>
<p>the time it takes for a message to get from sender to receiver</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. Throughput is affected by a number of factors such as, EMI and latency, so it rarely matches the specified bandwidth for a network medium. The throughput measurement includes user data bits and other data bits, such as overhead, acknowledging, and encapsulation. The measure of the usable data transferred across the media is called goodput.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>3. A network administrator notices that some newly installed Ethernet cabling is carrying corrupt and distorted data signals. The new cabling was installed in the ceiling close to fluorescent lights and electrical equipment. Which two factors may interfere with the copper cabling and result in signal distortion and data corruption? (Choose two.)</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>EMI*</strong></span></p>
<p>crosstalk</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>RFI*</strong></span></p>
<p>signal attenuation</p>
<p>extended length of cabling</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>EMI and RFI signals can distort and corrupt data signals that are carried by copper media. These distortions usually come from radio waves and electromagnetic devices such as motors and florescent lights. Crosstalk is a disturbance that is caused by adjacent wires bundled too close together with the magnetic field of one wire affecting another. Signal attenuation is caused when an electrical signal begins to deteriorate over the length of a copper cable.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>4. Which characteristic describes crosstalk?</h3>
<p>the distortion of the network signal from fluorescent lighting</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>the distortion of the transmitted messages from signals carried in adjacent wires*</strong></span></p>
<p>the weakening of the network signal over long cable lengths</p>
<p>the loss of wireless signal over excessive distance from the access point</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>EMI and RFI can distort network signals because of interference from fluorescent lights or electric motors. Attenuation results in deterioration of the network signal as it travels along copper cabling. Wireless devices can experience loss of signals because of excessive distances from a access point, but this is not crosstalk. Crosstalk is the disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of the signal carried on an adjacent wire within the same cable.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>5. What technique is used with UTP cable to help protect against signal interference from crosstalk?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>twisting the wires together into pairs*</strong></span></p>
<p>wrapping a foil shield around the wire pairs</p>
<p>encasing the cables within a flexible plastic sheath</p>
<p>terminating the cable with special grounded connectors</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>To help prevent the effects of crosstalk, UTP cable wires are twisted together into pairs. Twisting the wires together causes the magnetic fields of each wire to cancel each other out.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>6. Refer to the exhibit. The PC is connected to the console port of the switch. All the other connections are made through FastEthernet links. Which types of UTP cables can be used to connect the devices?</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Zt8fCr9Ho3Y/UvqzYd65L4I/AAAAAAAAAHU/0RCjRL2LkVQ/w692-h135-no/p15-exa4-ccna1.png" /></p>
<p>1 – rollover, 2 – crossover, 3 – straight-through</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>1 – rollover, 2 – straight-through, 3 – crossover*</strong></span></p>
<p>1 – crossover, 2 – straight-through, 3 – rollover</p>
<p>1 – crossover, 2 – rollover, 3 – straight-through</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>A straight-through cable is commonly used to interconnect a host to a switch and a switch to a router. A crossover cable is used to interconnect similar devices together like switch to a switch, a host to a host, or a router to a router. If a switch has the MDIX capability, a crossover could be used to connect the switch to the router; however, that option is not available. A rollover cable is used to connect to a router or switch console port.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>7. Refer to the exhibit. What is wrong with the displayed termination?</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MVzh9vUAqNw/UvqzYdSdQ2I/AAAAAAAAAHY/01OR1gUO5mM/w351-h260-no/p18-exa4-ccna1.png" /></p>
<p>The woven copper braid should not have been removed.</p>
<p>The wrong type of connector is being used.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The untwisted length of each wire is too long.*</strong></span></p>
<p>The wires are too thick for the connector that is used.</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>When a cable to an RJ-45 connector is terminated, it is important to ensure that the untwisted wires are not too long and that the flexible plastic sheath surrounding the wires is crimped down and not the bare wires. None of the colored wires should be visible from the bottom of the jack.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>8. Which type of connector does a network interface card use?</h3>
<p>DIN</p>
<p>PS-2</p>
<p>RJ-11</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>RJ-45*</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>9. What is one advantage of using fiber optic cabling rather than copper cabling?</h3>
<p>It is usually cheaper than copper cabling.</p>
<p>It is able to be installed around sharp bends.</p>
<p>It is easier to terminate and install than copper cabling.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It is able to carry signals much farther than copper cabling.*</strong></span></p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Copper cabling is usually cheaper and easier to install than fiber optic cabling. However, fiber cables generally have a much greater signaling range than copper.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>10. Why are two strands of fiber used for a single fiber optic connection?</h3>
<p>The two strands allow the data to travel for longer distances without degrading.</p>
<p>They prevent crosstalk from causing interference on the connection.</p>
<p>They increase the speed at which the data can travel.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>They allow for full-duplex connectivity.*</strong></span></p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Light can only travel in one direction down a single strand of fiber. In order to allow for full-duplex communication two strands of fiber must be connected between each device.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>11. A network administrator is designing the layout of a new wireless network. Which three areas of concern should be accounted for when building a wireless network? (Choose three.)</h3>
<p>mobility options</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>security*</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>interference*</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>coverage area*</strong></span></p>
<p>extensive cabling</p>
<p>packet collision</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>The three areas of concern for wireless networks focus on the size of the coverage area, any nearby interference, and providing network security. Extensive cabling is not a concern for wireless networks, as a wireless network will require minimal cabling for providing wireless access to hosts. Mobility options are not a component of the areas of concern for wireless networks.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>12. Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for specifying the encapsulation method used for specific types of media?</h3>
<p>application</p>
<p>transport</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>data link*</strong></span></p>
<p>physical</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Encapsulation is a function of the data link layer. Different media types require different data link layer encapsulation.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>13. What are two services performed by the data link layer of the OSI model? (Choose two.)</h3>
<p>It encrypts data packets.</p>
<p>It determines the path to forward packets.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It accepts Layer 3 packets and encapsulates them into frames.*</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>It provides media access control and performs error detection.*</strong></span></p>
<p>It monitors the Layer 2 communication by building a MAC address table.</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>The data link layer is responsible for the exchange of frames between nodes over a physical network media. Specifically the data link layer performs two basic services:</p>
<ul>
<li>It accepts Layer 3 packets and encapsulates them into frames.</li>
<li>It provides media access control and performs error detection.</li>
</ul>
<p>Path determination is a service provided at Layer 3. A Layer 2 switch builds a MAC address table as part of its operation, but path determination is not the service that is provided by the data link layer.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>14. What is true concerning physical and logical topologies?</h3>
<p>The logical topology is always the same as the physical topology.</p>
<p>Physical topologies are concerned with how a network transfers frames.</p>
<p>Physical topologies display the IP addressing scheme of each network.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Logical topologies refer to how a network transfers data between devices.*</strong></span></p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>Physical topologies show the physical interconnection of devices. Logical topologies show the way the network will transfer data between connected nodes.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>15. Which method of data transfer allows information to be sent and received at the same time?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>full duplex*</strong></span></p>
<p>half duplex</p>
<p>multiplex</p>
<p>simplex</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>16. Which statement describes an extended star topology?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>End devices connect to a central intermediate device, which in turn connects to other central intermediate devices.*</strong></span></p>
<p>End devices are connected together by a bus and each bus connects to a central intermediate device.</p>
<p>Each end system is connected to its respective neighbor via an intermediate device.</p>
<p>All end and intermediate devices are connected in a chain to each other.</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>In an extended star topology, central intermediate devices interconnect other star topologies.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>17. Refer to the exhibit. Which statement describes the media access control methods that are used by the networks in the exhibit?</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L0y4YLtypkSOtYYEnj9D-RjE5mUUe87DvwzfivasB_NDIhf45moUBa2BZ6o1am1_tUps581vgbq546GNUOeNfYBtynhxLCbajfbDyQLXcETXgJ00Cmkr5uOvDdt1bRVBrEHNUEEKpzFmPpz79CzhZLa-c3874NioYK0mvm5oTgQntJPa__4pBteDaiAhwCc-jC6A3FOXR6apIUctpyuYG7fMhwPVsAp66mvLhHsVzo9yphgyeOUS2XRTlLn8UiYHPyOk_4vdQxZ0OQ71WpeA0WfY6R13tXyNlsI6VNM-SAOdl5JnUk8s7d97JOUHWCo_cxm-IMw3UTNue-i3e_0blYQnMTnYoHJK4CU_C032iore2KA7ukS_dN2bMHF_Uxg4TQpb6OJk1vuVygvLNLrtHos-Y4tY06taJ67VOgeM3FeAQjOQR5g5LxcQQnCmE3CXX97AUF-IHuXFjTLyGx_xtbxUamLfybQz823x2QJt5R_cRoZRUG9TbDDnzFLKZBkFEHFC9-C-PNcP8iEe-ucl7ttbyi1kVc0IBEqvT13KEVqjL_YFWohaZcoppkV5Q1Z44TnT=w549-h281-no" /></p>
<p>All three networks use CSMA/CA</p>
<p>None of the networks require media access control.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Network 1 uses CSMA/CD and Network 3 uses CSMA/CA.*</strong></span></p>
<p>Network 1 uses CSMA/CA and Network 2 uses CSMA/CD.</p>
<p>Network 2 uses CSMA/CA and Network 3 uses CSMA/CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>18. What is contained in the trailer of a data-link frame?</h3>
<p>logical address</p>
<p>physical address</p>
<p>data</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>error detection*</strong></span></p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>The trailer in a data-link frame contains error detection information that is pertinent to the frame included in the FCS field. The header contains control information, such as the addressing, while the area that is indicated by the word “data” includes the data, transport layer PDU, and the IP header.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>19. As data travels on the media in a stream of 1s and 0s how does a receiving node identify the beginning and end of a frame?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The transmitting node inserts start and stop bits into the frame.*</strong></span></p>
<p>The transmitting node sends a beacon to notify that a data frame is attached.</p>
<p>The receiving node identifies the beginning of a frame by seeing a physical address.</p>
<p>The transmitting node sends an out-of-band signal to the receiver about the beginning of the frame.</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>When data travels on the media, it is converted into a stream of 1s and 0s. The framing process inserts into the frame start and stop indicator flags so that the destination can detect the beginning and end of the frame.</p>
<p></p></div>
<h3>20. What is the function of the CRC value that is found in the FCS field of a frame?</h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>to verify the integrity of the received frame*</strong></span></p>
<p>to verify the physical address in the frame</p>
<p>to verify the logical address in the frame</p>
<p>to compute the checksum header for the data field in the frame</p>
<div class="message_box announce"><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>The CRC value in the FCS field of the received frame is compared to the computed CRC value of that frame, in order to verify the integrity of the frame. If the two values do not match, then the frame is discarded.</p>
