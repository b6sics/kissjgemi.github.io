<h1><strong>Review:&nbsp;PlayStation 4&nbsp;</strong></h1>
<div id="yiv7603869792yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1479478184048_6990">
<p>The PlayStation 4 was launched simultaneously with the Xbox One on November 2013; one year after the Wii U&rsquo;s launch. Its positioning on the market at launch was clear: The most powerful console on the market, at competitive price with a relatively simple architecture, ensuring continuous and easy third party development.</p>
<p>The DualShock 4 controller has received major upgrades when comparing to the DualShock 3. The controller is larger, more solid and with improved analogue sticks that allow more precision. The R2/L2 buttons have also received a significant upgrade &ndash; though still not perfect &ndash; making them more responsive and user friendly due to the better sense of resistance. However, all other buttons have become binary, as pressure sensitivity has been removed. The controller comes with a touch pad, six-axis motion detector, a LED light bar and speakers. Some of these features help with immersion for certain games &ndash; however none of them are game changing. Overall, the controller is very good and versatile &ndash; and game controls generally hit the sweet spot between precision, challenge and simplicity.</p>
<p>The design of the console is simple yet elegant. All versions are quite small thus, their presence will have little physical impact on the living room. In terms of power, the PS4 (and now the PS4 Pro) is significantly ahead of its competition and it is targeted at the high segment of gamers. As games now all need to be installed, even the 1Tb version feels quite small in terms of internal memory. This is not a big deal, however worth noting.</p>
<p>The UI of the PS4 is a significant improvement over that of the PS3. Installed software is visible, easy to select and finding the right options is somewhat easier in general. The PlayStation Store has also seen an overhaul and again for the better. In fact, in our opinion, after the PC platforms (Steam and GoG), it is the most user-friendly interface, making both browsing and shopping a pleasure on it.</p>
<p><strong>First party games</strong></p>
<p>In the eighth generation, at least so far, the PS4 struggles to reach the expectation left by the PS2 in terms of exclusive game content. If one takes away the remasters (God of War 3, The Last of Us, Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, Gravity Rush, Journey, Uncharted Collection), one is left with very little system sellers. Nevertheless, arguably the best action-RPG (Bloodborne), action-platformer (Ratchet &amp; Clank), action-adventure (Uncharted 4: A thief&rsquo;s end) and Shoot &lsquo;m up (Resogun) are all found only on this system. Additionally, there are other good exclusive options in the action-adventure (Infamous Second Son), puzzle platformer (Tearaway Unfolded), horror-adventure (Until Dawn) and FPS (Killzone: Shadow Fall) genres. There are also many anticipated releases for this console: God of War 4, Spiderman, Ni No Kuni 2, Nioh, the Last Guardian and Grand Turismo Sport. The games all have the potential to be great &ndash; time will tell. With the launch of the PS VR, we can also expect some good gaming experiences from Sony in the Virtual Reality segment.</p>
<p><strong>Third party games</strong></p>
<p>In terms of third party games, the selection on the PS4 is substantial, especially when considering that the console is only on the market for three years. There are great action-adventure games (Metal Gear Solid V, Deus Ex: Mankind divided, the rise of the Tomb Raider), shooters (Doom, Battlefield 1, Call of Duty, Overwatch), action-RPGs (the Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Diablo 3, Dark Souls 3), racers (Project Cars, Dirt Rally), and a nice selection of indie games (the Witness, Rocket League, Minecraft, Inside, Firewatch). Unfortunately, none of the PS3 games are backwards compatible.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The PlayStation 4 is the current powerhouse of the console market. With its third party library, it has superior selection to the Wii U. With its better graphical fidelity and better first party line-up we feel that it is slightly better than the Xbox One if we keep the competition strictly in the eighth generation. While the PC is more diverse and cheaper per games, the price point of the PS4 is significantly lower than a gaming PC. As such the PS4 is recommended as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>To the gamer who looks for the highest price quality available.</li>
<li>To the gamer who plays many games outside the racing and strategy (mouse based) genres. In all other genres, the PS4 is very strong.</li>
<li>To the gamer who is looking for a gaming system for playing mainly in the living room.</li>
</ol>
