<p>Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a game published and developed by Nintendo for the Wii in 2010. Super Mario Galaxy 2 is mix of classical 3D and 2.5D platform gameplay. While the concept of Mario does not need much introduction &ndash; the gameplay of Super Mario Galaxy 2, along with its predecessor, is very unique in the genre due to its advanced gravity mechanics leading to real 3D gameplay in the broadest sense. It has unrivaled level design with a good amount of diversity and unique and fun power ups that take full advantage of its mechanics. Thus, the gameplay is nearly flawless, with only minor issues of depth perception in certain situations.</p>
<p>Although Super Mario Galaxy 2 is displayed in 480p (released during the HD era), Nintendo shows that with well selected colors, high level of polish and the signature Nintendo style a game can go very far in terms of presentation. The game has timeless design that remains and will remain in the future just as pretty then upon release due to its charm and personality. This charm and atmosphere is only reinforced by the great music and the fun sound effects.</p>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy 2 is one of the best Mario games that was ever made &ndash; with amazing fun factor. Consequently, Super Mario Galaxy 2 is one of the best games ever made, and though debatable, I believe that it is the greatest platformer.</p>
