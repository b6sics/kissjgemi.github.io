<p>Simcity 2000 is a city management simulator developed by Maxis. The game is sandbox game in which the player is free to develop the city at his heart&rsquo;s content, only being constrained by the available budget. The player can select three general type of development areas (residential, commercial, industrial), roads, public service buildings and energy and water providing facilities. Upon achieving certain benchmarks, some unique buildings and hallmarks become also available to be placed. These buildings can be mixed a la carte, and their combination will determine the state of the city ranging from poor underdeveloped criminal slums to luxurious clean skyscrapers.</p>
<p>The game is set in a fictional city (named by the player) and the player has the possibility to run it from us early as 1900. As the years progress the player will get new better technologies to improve the city. The entire game has &lsquo;90s vibe to it, with buildings both from the past and future resemble the imagination of the time when the game was made, thereby creating a unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, despite the pixelated graphics, the art-direction of the game is timeless. The sound effects are slightly dated but not annoying and the music fits the action on the display. The buildings are diverse and good looking; and the menus are also user-friendly enough when considering the game&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>Overall, this game is still fun and holds up well for the most part. The only part of the game that is not up to par with the rest is the simulation of disasters. These are wildly inconsistent, and frankly frustrating. I strongly recommend to all players to switch it off, as the game play revolving this element of the game is neither consistent nor rewarding in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>As conclusion, if you have not yet played Simcity 2000, go and get it on GoG, switch of the disasters and have a blast. A true timeless classic.</p>
