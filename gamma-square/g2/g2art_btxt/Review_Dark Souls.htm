There are two core mechanics of the game: Combat and exploration. The combat is difficult and deadly where the player needs to constantly read the movements of enemies and make risk-reward decisions, while managing resources that quickly dwindle away if left unchecked. This is especially true in the case of the game&rsquo;s many boss encounters that are highlights of the game. Exploration is also very important; as one of the most important aim for the player is to find&nbsp;bone fires. Bone fires stock healing items, let the player level up and act as check points where the player returns upon death. &nbsp;This is important as the player loses all acquired souls &ndash; the games only currency used for both upgrading the character and items; and the player has to start from the last check point again with all enemies respawned. If the player manages to get back to the point of death without dying again, the player can reacquire said souls that otherwise are lost forever. When played online in case of difficulties, players can summon other players for help in order to overcome obstacles. In turn other players may invade the player, ensuing in tight and hectic PvP battles.</span></div>

The story of the game is minimalistic, explained mainly through item descriptions and placements. However, when creating the game, the main emphasis was put on creating an inter-connected world that oozes with atmosphere. The truly unforgettable atmosphere is partially achieved with the complex vertical level design and with the great art-direction. Sounds and voices all suit the game perfectly, as does the music that plays during boss fights. The graphics are beautiful in terms of art, however on the technical side there are some notable issue: Minor graphical glitches, major frame rate drops and a rag doll physics model that is inconsistent.</span></div>

Definitely not for the faint of heart.</span></div>

<div>Artorias of the Abyss is the expansion that was released for Dark Souls. Some of the best boss fights and weapons can be found in the expansion that is well worth the entrance fee. The core elements of the game-play remain unchanged, though the new areas are more linear than those in the original game.</div>
