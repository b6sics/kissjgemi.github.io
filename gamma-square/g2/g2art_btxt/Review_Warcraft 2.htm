<p>In 1995 Blizzard followed up the critically acclaimed Warcraft, leading to the creation of one of the most influential games ever made. Warcraft 2 is a real time strategy game, in which the &ldquo;gather resources, build a base, upgrade units and conquer the map&rdquo; gameplay has been perfected within the restrictions of its era. The player can choose from two races: the alliance or the orcs. Although the units on the two sides are mostly identical, the difference between paladins and ogre magi foreshadowed the asymmetric gameplay of future Blizzard games. The gameplay is simplistic by today&rsquo;s standards but still fun. However, it micro management is significantly harder, than in newer more stream-lined games of today &ndash; as less units can be selected, with less developed AI and issues with pathfinding.</p>
<p>The setting of Warcraft 2 is a dark fantasy universe with many different planets, races and intricacies in a complex universe with lore spanning through several millennia. What makes the universe so great, is the rich detail that each story received; and Warcraft 2 is no exception. Although the story telling is very basic when comparing to later games in the universe, it is clear that there is an overarching coherent saga that this game is part of.</p>
<p>The art-direction of Warcraft 2 is also very good. Though the sound effects and voice-overs are basic by today&rsquo;s standards, they do not subtract from the experience. The graphics, especially the well-drawn sprites, still look very good in their simplistic way.</p>
<p>Warcraft 2 is recommended to all players who played and like the other Blizzard games and to those wish to learn more about the lore of Warcraft.</p>
