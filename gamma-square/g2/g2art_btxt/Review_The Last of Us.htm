<h1><strong>Review:&nbsp;The Last of Us</strong></h1>
<div id="yiv7603869792yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1479478184048_6990">
<p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure survival/horror game developed for the PS3 by Naughty Dog and released by Sony in 2013. On the surface the Last of Us seems to be the usual survival/horror game in a post-apocalyptic setting due to a deadly epidemic; and indeed the game does touch almost all expected clich&eacute;s of the genre. However, the devil lies in the details and it is not its ideas and innovation that elevates the Last of Us from its competition, but its all-encompassing high-level implementation. Stealth mechanics work well and are just forgiving enough to be fun (even on higher difficulties), combat is heavy and visceral, and resources are scarce giving scavenging and exploration a strong emphasis.</p>
<p>And then there is the setting and the story&hellip; Again, it is nothing that we have not seen it before, but the characters, the scenario and pacing are perfect. The evolving relationship of Joel and Ellie and their gradually shifting personalities are very heartwarming and represent a strong contrast to the somber and brutal world depicted in the Last of Us. Besides the strong writing, the (voice) actors put up an excellence performance &ndash; creating flesh and blood characters. This is supported by a coherent art direction in terms of both music (amazing sound track) and graphical design.</p>
<p>Although the Last of Us is not the greatest story of video gaming, it is the best played and acted story that created from a diamond in the rough a true system seller master piece.&nbsp; It is a must-buy for all PlayStation owners. (And it also has quite decent multiplayer).</p>

<p>The Left Behind DLC adds a couple of hours of balanced action between combat and story-heavy exploration. With the focus on Ellie, this DLC is an essential part of game and should not be missed.</p>
