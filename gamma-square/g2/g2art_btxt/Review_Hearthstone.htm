<h1><strong>Review: Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</strong></h1>
<p>Hearthstone is free-to-play online card game. There are two battling players on each side of the playing field; and players play out cards turn-per-turn. There are nine possible classes to choose from, each coming with their unique abilities and cards. These cards can be minions, spells, or other special moves/abilities. Additionally, there are nearly a thousand neutral cards that can be added to any deck for additional combination options, leading to nearly infinite possibilities for specialized decks and combos. The aim of the game is to collect cards to build stronger/ consistent decks. Cards can be collected by purchasing them, meeting certain requirements or winning them in the arena. The game is governed by the in game currency of gold, that is needed to make purchases and enter events such as the arena or quests acquired via DLC. Of course the real currency is always a possible substitute for gold.</p>

<p>The game itself plays in the deep and interesting world of the Warcraft Lore, and it shows. Although the quest lines are less interesting than other Blizzard products in terms of storytelling, in terms of atmosphere one feels immediately &ldquo;home&rdquo; in the familiar Blizzard setting.</p>
<p>Both the visual and the audio art-direction is fantastic. The different cards can be recognized easily from one another and the simplistic visuals give the game very polished look. The sound effects and voice acting is also very fitting to the different actions and characters, and Blizzard veterans will definitely appreciate the effort that was put also into this aspect of the game.</p>
<p>The only issues I have encountered was the match-making system which pairs you at around 30 percent of the time with players of significantly different skill level. This can lead to minor frustrations, but given the well-designed quest system you are often still rewarded for playing and not only winning. Also I find the DLC quite expensive for the extra content that one gets, however given the free entrance and the replayability, the overall value for money of the game is still great.</p>
<p>Overall the game is very polished and balanced and given the free entrance it is recommended to all players, at least for a test run.</p>
