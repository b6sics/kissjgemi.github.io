<p>Bioshock was developed by 2K Games (now Irrational Games) in 2007. It is a first person shooter with RPG and horror elements. The aim of the game is to explore the levels in non-linear fashion (though the order in which the levels become available is linear) in order to figure out how to progress. There are several enemies, traps and obstacles that try to prevent the player to do so, and it is up to the player to overcome these by either using weapons, hacking or plasmids. Plasmids are the result of genetic experiments that modify the DNA of the player character and thereby giving him either active or passive superpowers. These range from classical abilities such as fire and ice bolt, to abilities such as invisibility and telekinesis. In order to progress the player has to collect ADAM (xp of Bioshock), which can be obtained for the most party only from Little Sisters. Little Sisters are harvesters that recover the ADAM from dead bodies, and for this dangerous job they are all protected by a guardian called the Big Daddy. The only way for the player to get the ADAM is to take on these fast and deadly body guards. The player is supposed to select a good place for encountering these massive beings and set-up traps in order to make these encounters easier. Overall, the game-play is slow, tactical and deliberate that suits the over theme of the game.</p>
<p>Bioshock is set in an underwater city called Rapture. Rapture is a city that was created 1950s as an alternative to communism, capitalism and religion; as a place where science and art would not be bound by morality and ethics. However, the population became addicted to the ADAM harvested from undersea slugs and through its repetitive usage they gradually lost their sanity. In 1960 the player arrives in Rapture; and by this time the once utopian city has become dystopian nightmare of horrors, gang wars and criminally insane. The setting of the game is very interesting, with a strong story and suprising twists. Only the black-and-white moral choice system of the game falls a flat as it misses any sort of ambiguity as the player can either play a saint or an evil psychopath.</p>
<p>The art-direction of Bioshock is excellent on all departments. Sounds and voices are excellent, as is the ominous music. The graphics are beautiful from both technically and artistically. With the philosophical interactions, the beautiful Art Deco architecture and the strong contrasting colors Bioshock creates a world that truly lives and breathes.</p>
<p>After finishing Bioshock, I spent hours reading and researching about Ayn Rand and her contemporaries because I was so engrossed into the experience. Bioshock is a true masterpiece, that is recommended to all players who don&rsquo;t mind elements of horror.</p>
