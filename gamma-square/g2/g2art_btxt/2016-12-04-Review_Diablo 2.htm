<p>Diablo 2 is an action-RPG developed and released by Blizzard in 2000. Following the events of the original Diablo, it is the player&rsquo;s task to follow the Dark Wanderer throughout five acts in total (including the expansion Lord of Destruction). To do so, the player has to choose one out seven characters to battle countless monsters, demons and other corrupted beings. Enemies are attacked with the left and right clicks of the mouse &ndash; to each one of the game&rsquo;s many attacks or abilities may be assigned. Each class has three specializations, and the investments skill points into these specializations and the weapon selected together determine the playstyle. Skill points together with attributes are gained automatically by killing enemies and finishing some quests. Weapons can be obtained either via the random loot system or be purchased from vendors. The controls are simple and work for the most part well &ndash; though when facing multiple enemies, which happens very often, it is not always evident to select the correct enemy to attack.</p>
<p>Although the story itself is not too complex, the cinematics and the overall atmosphere portray the hopelessness and the corruption of the game very well. This is strongly supported by the strong art direction in graphics and sound departments &ndash; that even today, 16 years after release, look and sound great. The music also sets the ambiance perfectly, with each Act coming with its own theme.</p>
<p>Diablo 2 is a true classic that should be played by everyone, not just fans of the genre. It is especially recommended to players who enjoy games with randomly generated loot (of which Diablo 2 seems to have an infinite amount) on randomly generated levels. Still available on Battle.net.</p>

<p>The expansion, Lord of Destruction, is a must own for all players of Diablo 2. Not only does it conclude the saga with the added Act Five, but it also adds to new interesting classes to play to the original five. Do not miss it.</p>
