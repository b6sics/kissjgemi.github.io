	<div id="listDiv" class="listClass">
		<div class="columns justified">
			<p class="justified">
			The Wii U was the first eight generation console release on November 18, 2012. It is also the first Nintendo 
			console that supports HD graphics and is backwards compatible with all Wii software and most accessories. 
			It is also the cheapest of the three eighth generation consoles.
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			What sets the Wii U apart from its competition is the gigantic game pad that supports a 854X480 touch screen 
			in the middle of the controller that was supposed to help creating unique dual screen experiences. Unfortunately 
			till this day, only very few games take full advantage of this feature – and most games use it as a high tech 
			inventory screen.
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			The controller feels solid, well-built and surprisingly light; albeit in terms of dimensions slightly too large. 
			The battery life as an acceptable 4-6 hours, which in our opinion is adequate. Players who prefer alternative 
			controls can go with the Wii remote or the Wii U Pro controller. The control of the games feels very good, 
			and Nintendo does not disappoint in this area. No matter if we speak about platformers, racers or 
			action-adventure games – the controls are precise and consistent across all genres.
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			In terms of dimensions the Wii U is a small (6.8in X 1.8in X 10.6 in / 17.2cm X 4.6cm X 26.9cm), traditional 
			looking console – apart from the controller – that minimizes the attention paid to it. When looking at the specs, 
			at first glance it is visible that in terms of raw power it is inferior to both its direct competitors.  
			This cost-conscious approach is also evident when looking at the rather humble 32Gb Hard drive – in case 
			of the deluxe set – and with only (!) 8 Gb internal memory in case of the basic set.
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			However, despite the concerning data above, Wii U games are beautiful with vibrant colors and a very clean look 
			in general. Many games not only look beautiful but run also at a stable 60 fps. While admittedly Nintendo is 
			slightly behind the competition in this regard, the difference is much more minor than what the spec differences 
			would suggest. Overall the graphics are great, and this is ought not be a factor for not getting a Wii U.
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			The UI of the Wii U gives at first glance an elegant and simplistic impression that is typical for Nintendo 
			products. The options are clear and easy to manage as are most of the menus. The Nintendo Eshop on the other 
			hand is far behind the competition regarding, both offered options and functionality. The search function 
			does not always work properly, and bundling multiple objects together into the shopping cart does not always 
			work. This makes shopping on the Eshop a hustle despite the interesting products offered. Overall, UI is 
			functional, but not great.
			</p>
			<h2>
			First Party games
			</h2>
			<p class="justified">
			This is where Nintendo always shines, and the Wii U is no exception. Great first party and exclusive third party 
			titles define this system. Next to the usual suspects (Super Mario Bros. U, Super Mario 3D World, 
			Zelda HD versions), the generation’s arguably best hack ‘n slash action-adventure (Bayonetta 2), 
			fighting game (Super Smash Bros.), racing game (Mario Kart 8) and platformer (Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze) 
			are only on this system. As are several creative titles (Captain Toad, Splatoon, Affordable Space Adventures), 
			spinoffs (Yoshi’s Wooly World, Hyrule Warriors), and sequels (Pikmin 3, Xenoblade Chronicles X) that make 
			the library of the Wii U absolutely unique in terms of high quality experience. If one takes additionally 
			into account all the titles released for the Wii (all fully functional on the Wii U), it is clear that 
			the library of the Wii U has the potential for several thousands of very high quality gaming time. Overall, 
			the Wii U has the strongest first party/exclusive library from all systems by a large margin.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Third party games
			</h2>
			<p class="justified">
			While Nintendo is strong at creating own gaming experiences, the continuing lack of support from third party 
			developers does thin out the overall number of good games when comparing to the competition. With a very few 
			exceptions at launch (Mass Effect 3, Batman Arkham City, Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag), all the big publishers 
			stopped supporting this console and it shows. If one wishes to play with the newest games from Ubisoft, EA,
			Activision-Blizzard or Bethesda, one needs to look elsewhere. Luckily for the console indie developers have 
			seen more potential in the console thus some gems, such as Shovel Knight, are also accessible to owners 
			of the Wii U. Overall, the Wii U’s third party support is by far the weakest making the overall selection 
			of good games lower than that of other consoles.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Conclusion 
			</h2>
			<p class="justified">
			We would recommend the Wii U to 4 types of gamers.
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			 1. To the gamer that looks for the absolutely cheapest way to play current generation games who purchases 
			typically 2-3 long-lasting games per year. Software is more expensive than the competition, but online is 
			free of charge. 
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			 2. To the gamer that looks for unique and diverse experiences that cannot be found elsewhere. Basically 
			players who like many different genres on a very high quality level. 
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			 3. To owners of another game console that plan to get a second console. Wii U is the best second console 
			because of its exclusive lineup.  
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			 4. To all people who did not own a Wii. Wii + Wii U games = thousands of hours of fun. 
			</p>
			<p class="justified">
			For all other players, we recommend one of the other 3 possibilities for home console/PC.
